# What's that bug?: There's an app for that.

Want to know the name of that strange insect that just landed in front of you? There's free cell phone app for that
called iNaturalist. 

iNaturalist allows you to use your phone to snap pictures of any animals or plants and upload them to an online database connected to a global network
of nature lovers who are willing to help you identify it. Locations and times of the observations are recorded automatically.

Dr. Aubrey Moore, a UOG entomologist, has been using iNaturalist quite a bit lately for several different uses:

* When Moore is emailed photos of insects for identification, these are posted to an iNaturalist project called *Insects of Micronesia* and a link 
to the identified images is emailed back to the client. The project is publicly available and can be used as a reference to identify many of Guam's most common insects.
* The *Insects of Micronesia* project is used UOG students in Moore's entomology courses to document and help identify insects they collect. 
* iNaturalist projects can be used for insect surveys. For example iNaturalist was used to map the spread of the greater banded hornet, a newly arrived invasive species. In another example, students in Dr. Curt Feidler's environmental biology course used and [iNaturalist project to map coconut rhinoceros beetle damage](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/uog-bi-100l-coconut-tree-survey-sp-16).
