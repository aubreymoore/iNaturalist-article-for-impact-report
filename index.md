# What's that bug?: There's an app for that.

Want to know the name of that strange insect that just landed in front of you? There's free cell phone app for that
called iNaturalist. 

iNaturalist allows you to use your phone to snap a picture of any animal or plant and upload it to global network
of nature lovers who are willing to help you identify it. Location and time of the observation are recorded automatically.

Dr. Aubrey Moore, a UOG entomologist, has been using iNaturalist quite a bit lately for several different uses:

* When Moore is emailed photos of insects for identification, these are posted to an iNaturalist project called *Insects of Micronesia* and a link 
to the posted images and identification is emailed back to the client.
* The *Insects of Micronesia* project is used UOG students in Moore's entomology courses to document and help identify insects they collect. 
* iNaturalist projects can be used for insect surveys. For example, UOG biologists Dr. Wei and Dr. Feidler, had students mapping coconut rhinoceros beetle damage 
as part of an ecology course. recently, iNaturalist was used to map the spread of the greater banded hornet, a newly arrived invasive species.
